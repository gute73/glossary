    <h1 class='center'>About</h1>
    <p>The Glossary app crowd-sources translation by allowing registered users (for both free and paid accounts) to create glossaries of terms in need of translation. Each glossary covers a particular topic or subject matter, and contains three to five terms. Registered users may search the glossaries by topic, select a term, and translate that term into any language that they wish.</p>
